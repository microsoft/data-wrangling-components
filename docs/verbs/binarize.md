# binarize

Converts values to a 0 or 1 based on a comparison function match. This is commonly used in machine learning models where the input data needs to be turned into a series of flags. See [filter](./filter.md) for a description of the comparison functions available.  Multiple criteria can be applied against the input column, which will be treated as a series of [boolean](./boolean.md) queries.

## Examples
