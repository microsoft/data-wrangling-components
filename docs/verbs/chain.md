**chain** executes a series of verbs. This is essentially the core engine of the project. Chains can be included within parent chains, so the execution proceeds recursively. By default, each chain execution creates its own table store context so that it does not pollute the parent context with intermediate tables. The end of the chain returns the final output table. Specifying the `nofork` option will pass the parent context recursively, allowing for collection of all intermediate tables.
