# filter

Creates a filtered table that only contains rows that match specified criteria. Filter can compare the values of an input column to a fixed value (e.g.) `row.value <= 10`), or it can compare to the value of another column in the same row (e.g., `row.value <= row.other_value`). Comparisons can be numeric (=, !=, <, >, etc.) or string-based (equals, contains, starts with, etc.). If an empty/not empty filter is _not_ specified but invalid values are found, the result for that comparison will be a negative match. Multiple criteria can be applied against the input column, which will be treated as a series of [boolean](./boolean.md) queries.

`filter where column['fy20'] < 200`:

| fy20 | fy21 |
| ---- | ---- |
| 100  | 124  |
| 23   | 165  |

`filter where column['fy20'] > column['fy21']`:
