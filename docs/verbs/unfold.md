# unfold

Reverses a [fold](./fold.md) operation. This is similar to a [pivot](./pivot.md), but pivot performs an aggregate when inverting the operation, rather than restoring the original rows.

## Example

| key  | value |
| ---- | ----- |
| id   | 1     |
| name | Bob   |
| id   | 2     |
| name | Joe   |
| id   | 3     |
| name | Jenny |

`unfold key['key'] value['value']`:

| id  | name  |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | Bob   |
| 2   | Joe   |
| 3   | Jenny |
