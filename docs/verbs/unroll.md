**unroll** unrolls array-valued cells into new rows. Similar to [spread](./spread.md), but generating new rows instead of columns. Akin to a denormalize operation - other column values in the row are copied to the new rows.

Example

| id  | values      |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | [10, 15]    |
| 2   | [1, 11, 18] |

`unroll column['values']`:

| id  | values |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   | 10     |
| 1   | 15     |
| 2   | 1      |
| 2   | 11     |
| 2   | 18     |
