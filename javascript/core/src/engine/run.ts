/**
 * This is a fairly simplistic processing engine that executes a series of table manipulations with our verbs.
 * Most of these thunk down to Arquero directly (see the verbs folder), but they don't need to.
 * The list of steps is intended to be serializable so it can be stored or executed later or server-side.
 * Each step is async so service invocations could be inserted if necessary, such as for processing a very large step
 * or when client-side steps aren't implemented.
 * WARNING: the store is used as a chain context, and its contents are mutated.
 * @param spec -
