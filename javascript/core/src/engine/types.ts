 * We deviate here in order to support some specific needs, such as:
 * - not wanting to be completely wedded to Arquero
 * - wanting async so we can lazy-load tables or invoke services
 * - building compound steps with recursive execution.
 * TODO: this could hide the TableStore for easier api use, and just provide proxy methods.
