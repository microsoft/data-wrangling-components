 * Manages a series of pipeline steps,
 * including creating default names, executing in order, etc.
 * This and the accompanying TableStore are very similar to Arquero's
 * notion of queries. Both are basically a chain pattern with context.
 * We deviate here in order to support some specific needs, such as:
 * - not wanting to be completely wedded to Arquero
 * - wanting async so we can lazy-load tables or invoke services
 * - building compound steps with recursive execution.
 * TODO: this could hide the TableStore for easier api use, and just provide proxy methods.
