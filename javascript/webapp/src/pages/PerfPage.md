This page provides a simple way of assessing pipeline and rendering performance using a dev tools profiler.

By default a largish table is rendered on the main tab. You can toggle between this and the other tabs to assess whether rendering remains fast even with component mount/unmount.

The empty tab has nothing on it so you can easily compare how quickly an empty component renders compared to the full table.

The grouped tab has a large table grouped by multiple columns to evaluate grouping performance and how the table's virtual rendering is affected.
